You already send agent traces to Splunk Agent Observability from Part 1. In this section you turn on **log stream evaluators** so the platform automatically scores each investigation — not just records it.

Evaluators answer questions that are hard to judge by eye across dozens of runs:

- Did the agent pick the **right MCP tools** for the alert?
- Did tool calls **fail** because of bad parameters?
- Is the final answer **grounded in tool output**, or does it sound plausible without evidence?
- Did the agent **complete** the investigation goal, or stop early?


## Before you start

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [Part 1 investigation completed]({{< relref "6-part1-baseline-agent" >}}) | We will use the session/trace from the previous section to compare the before and after enabling evaluators |
| `.env` Agent Observability settings saved | Same `GALILEO_PROJECT` and `GALILEO_LOG_STREAM` you used in Part 1 |
| Splunk Agent Observability console access | Open the project your facilitator shared (or the one you created with `GALILEO_PROJECT`) |

Most out-of-the-box evaluators use an **SLM** (Luna) or **LLM-as-a-judge** to score traces. Prefer **SLM** when configuring evaluators. Your workshop instance should already have an LLM integration configured. If evaluator scores stay empty after several minutes, ask your facilitator to verify **Integrations** in the Splunk Agent Observability console.

## Open your log stream

1. Sign in to the [Splunk Agent Observability console](https://console.multitenant.galileocloud.io).
2. Open **Projects** and select your project (for example, `sre-agent-wkshp-shw-2cb1`).
3. Select **Agent Stream** in the sidebar — this is the log stream named in your `.env` (for example, `sre-agent-wkshp`).
4. Confirm you see at least one session from Part 1 (for example, `chat-9265e3375c8b | part1_agent`).

## Configure evaluators

1. From the log stream view, click **Configure Evaluators**.
2. Search or filter the evaluator list.
3. Turn on the evaluators in the tables below.
4. When the console offers a choice between **LLM** and **SLM** (Luna), select **SLM** — same scoring intent, with lower latency and cost during the workshop.
5. Click **Apply** to save your evaluator selections. Toggles alone do not take effect until you apply.
6. When Agent Observability asks whether to compute evaluators on **past logs**, click **Not Now**. Your Part 1 session stays as the **without evaluators** baseline; you will run a fresh investigation next so you can compare both traces side by side.

{{< notice title="Why Not Now?" style="tip" >}}
Keep your first Part 1 session un-scored on purpose. After you re-run the same chat command, you will have two sessions in the same log stream: one **trace only** (Part 1) and one **trace + evaluator scores** (this section). That makes the before/after difference easy to see.
{{< /notice >}}
{{< notice title="Prefer SLM when available" style="tip" >}}
Many built-in evaluators have an **SLM** variant powered by Luna models. Use SLM for workshop runs unless your facilitator asks you to compare against the full LLM judge. If you do not see an SLM option for an evaluator, the LLM variant is fine.

## Recommended evaluators

Enable evaluators from **two categories** that map directly to troubleshooting-agent quality. Not every evaluator applies to every span type — the platform only scores where the node type matches.

### Agent behavior — tools and progress

Use these to score **how the agent investigates**, not just what it says at the end.

| Evaluator | Node type | What it tells you | Workshop focus |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| [**Tool selection quality**](https://docs.galileo.ai/concepts/metrics/agentic/tool-selection-quality) | LLM span | Whether the model chose appropriate tools for the task | Did it call `o11y_get_apm_service_errors_and_requests` vs. skipping straight to a vague answer? |
| [**Tool error**](https://docs.galileo.ai/concepts/metrics/agentic/tool-error) | Tool span | Failures during tool execution | Catches MCP validation errors (for example, missing `environment_name`) |
| [**Action Completion**](https://docs.galileo.ai/concepts/metrics/agentic/action-completion) | Session | Whether the agent achieved the user's goal | Did it actually investigate errors, or only ask clarifying questions? |

**Minimum set for Part 1:** turn on **Tool selection quality**, **Tool error**, and **Action Completion**.

### Response quality — hallucination and grounding

These evaluators judge the **final answer** against the evidence available in the trace.

| Evaluator | Node type | What it tells you | Workshop focus |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| [**Context Adherence**](https://docs.galileo.ai/concepts/metrics/rag/generation-quality/context-adherence) | LLM span | Closed-domain hallucination — claims not supported by provided context | Scores low when the model invents service names, error rates, or root causes not present in MCP JSON |
| [**Instruction Adherence**](https://docs.galileo.ai/concepts/metrics/response-quality/instruction-adherence) | LLM span | Whether the model followed system instructions | Part 1's prompt requires using `o11y_*` tools for live data |

**Minimum set for hallucination checks:** turn on **Context Adherence** and **Instruction Adherence**.

After you click **Apply**, reopen **Configure Evaluators** to confirm your selections. It should look similar to this:

{{< diagram src="images/evaluators-selection.png" alt="Splunk Agent Observability Configure Evaluators pane with workshop evaluators enabled" >}}



## Exercise — score your baseline run

After you apply evaluators and click **Not Now** on past logs, re-run the same Part 1 investigation. You will end up with two sessions in your log stream: your original Part 1 run (trace only) and this new run (trace + evaluator scores).

### Run the investigation

Re-run the same Part 1 investigation. Use the workshop defaults — service **`paymentservice`**, environment **`splunk-hipster`**:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Script" open="true" %}}

```bash
cd ~/troubleshooting-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
cd part1_agent
troubleshooting-agent chat "Why does paymentservice have errors in the splunk-hipster environment?"
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

You can also paste alert text from the facilitator's demo. Use **`paymentservice`** and **`splunk-hipster`** when asking about the workshop demo service.


### Review the run in Splunk Agent Observability

After your chat completes, open the [Splunk Agent Observability console](https://console.multitenant.galileocloud.io) and navigate to:

1. **Project** — the name you set (for example, `sre-agent-wkshp-shw-2cb1`)
2. **Agent Stream** — your log stream from `.env` (for example, `sre-agent-wkshp`)
3. **Sessions** — use the session picker (for example, **Session 2 of 2**) to find your two Part 1 runs: the original (trace only) and the newest (with evaluator scores)

Select the **newest** session. When the environment is in the prompt, the trace tree often shows **multiple tool rounds** — the agent is trying, even if the final answer is still incomplete:

```text
Agent (~20s)
├── Agent:agent
│   ├── should_continue
│   └── tools
│       └── o11y_get_apm_services
├── Agent:agent
│   ├── should_continue
│   └── tools
│       └── o11y_get_apm_service_errors_and_requests
├── Agent:agent
│   └── should_continue
```

If the environment is missing, you may see a **shallower** trace instead — for example a single call to `o11y_get_apm_environments` and a response asking you to specify the environment.

The center panel shows the **chat** — your query and the agent's final response. On the right, open the **Evaluators** tab to see scores grouped under headings such as **Agent Quality**. SLM evaluators are labeled with **(SLM)**, for example:

- **Tool Selection Quality (SLM)** — did the model choose appropriate MCP tools?
- **Tool Error (SLM)** — did any tool calls fail?
- **Action Completion (SLM)** — did the agent finish the job, or stop at summaries and "next steps"?
- **Context Adherence (SLM)** — are claims grounded in tool output?
- **Instruction Adherence (SLM)** — did the agent follow the system prompt (use `o11y_*` tools for live data)?

Click into each **`tools`** span to inspect MCP inputs, outputs, and span-level evaluators. Use the **chat** panel and **Evaluators** tab together — a detailed-sounding answer can still score low if the agent did not complete the investigation.

{{< diagram src="images/part1-galileo-trace-with-env.png" alt="Splunk Agent Observability Agent Stream showing a Part 1 re-run with evaluator scores in the Agent Quality panel" caption="Part 1 re-run with evaluators enabled. Low action scores are common when the agent stops at suggested next steps." width="960" >}}

Work through this checklist using **`paymentservice`** in environment **`splunk-hipster`**:

1. Run `troubleshooting-agent chat "Why does paymentservice have errors in the splunk-hipster environment?"` (same as Part 1).
2. Open Splunk Agent Observability **Agent Stream** — find **both** sessions using the session picker (for example, **Session 2 of 3** for the scored re-run).
3. On the **newest** session, expand the trace tree — confirm multiple **`tools`** spans ran (not just a single environment lookup).
4. Click each MCP span — do the numbers and facts in the **chat** response match the tool JSON?
5. Open the **Evaluators** tab and record scores under **Agent Quality** (and other groups if present).
6. **Compare** your sessions — the Part 1 baseline (trace only) vs. this run (trace + evaluator scores).
7. **Save your notes and scores** — you will re-run the same scenario in Part 2 and Part 3.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="What good looks like" %}}

A strong Part 1 run (for a data-rich environment) might show:

- **Tool selection quality** — high; tools align with APM errors, traces, or dependencies
- **Tool error** — high (no failures)
- **Action Completion** — moderate to high; a clear root-cause summary, not just suggested next steps
- **Context Adherence** — high; conclusions cite numbers and service names from MCP JSON
- **Instruction Adherence** — high; the agent used `o11y_*` tools for live data instead of answering from the prompt alone

A shallow run (missing environment) is still useful baseline data:

- Single tool call such as `o11y_get_apm_environments`, then the agent **asks for environment**
- **Action Completion (SLM)** — **0%**; the investigation never started

A deeper run that **still scores low** is common in Part 1 — the screenshot above is a real example:

- Prompt includes environment; agent calls `o11y_get_apm_services` and `o11y_get_apm_service_errors_and_requests`
- Chat cites real numbers (for example, 68 errors in the last hour) — looks productive at first glance
- **Action Completion (SLM)** — still low (for example **2%**) because the agent stops at a summary and offers "next steps" instead of finishing the investigation

Other weak patterns to watch for:

- **Tool selection quality** — low; model answered without calling tools
- **Context Adherence** — low; detailed root cause with empty or failed tool output
- **Instruction Adherence** — low; the agent skipped required `o11y_*` tools or ignored the system prompt

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="When scores are missing" %}}

If evaluator scores do not appear:

1. Confirm you ran a **new** investigation after saving evaluator settings
2. Check **Configure Evaluators** — the evaluator toggle is still on and you clicked **Apply**
3. Verify sampling is **100%** under **Evaluator Sampling** in the same pane
4. Ask your facilitator to confirm the **LLM integration** is configured in Splunk Agent Observability

{{< notice title="Tip" style="tip" >}}
Part 1 intentionally has **no playbook**, so results can range from weak to strong across runs and even between participants. A response can **sound detailed** in the chat panel but still score poorly on **Action Completion** — evaluators help you see that gap without reading every tool JSON by hand.

## What you learned

- Log streams **capture** traces; **evaluators** score them automatically on each session after you enable them.
- Clicking **Not Now** on past logs keeps a clean **before/after** pair of sessions to compare.
- **Agentic evaluators** (tool selection, tool error, action completion) measure investigation behavior.
- **Response quality evaluators** (context adherence, instruction adherence) surface **hallucination** and prompt-following gaps.
- Baseline **Part 1 scores** become your ruler when you add skills (Part 2) and graph structure (Part 3) on the same alert.
