Before building a troubleshooting agent, it helps to see how the pieces fit together. An AI agent is not just a chat model — it is a **system** that combines reasoning, action, and feedback loops. The diagram below shows the main components and how data flows between them during a typical investigation.

## Review the Agent Orchestration Layer

The **agent** is the orchestrator. It accepts a goal (for example, *“investigate this latency alert”*), decides what to do next, calls tools when it needs data, and produces a final answer. Unlike a single prompt/response chat, an agent runs in a **loop**: plan → act → observe → repeat until the task is done or a limit is reached.

Common patterns you will encounter:

| Pattern | What it does | Example in this workshop |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **ReAct** | Reason about the task, then call a tool, then reason again from the result | Part 1 and Part 2 agents |
| **Graph / workflow** | Fixed stages with specialized nodes (identify, investigate, report) | Part 3 LangGraph workflow |
| **Tool routing** | Choose which capability to invoke based on context | Skill injection in Part 2; product routing in Part 3 |

**Frameworks** provide the scaffolding for these patterns so you do not wire loops, state, and tool calls from scratch:

- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** — Chains, agents, tool bindings, and LLM integrations. Good for composing prompts, tools, and memory in Python (and other languages).
- **[LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)** — State machines and multi-step graphs on top of LangChain. Used when you need explicit stages, branching, and durable workflow state (Part 3).

**Other ecosystems** — the concepts in this workshop (ReAct loops, tools, multi-step workflows) appear in many frameworks. LangChain is a general-purpose composition layer with a large integration catalog; the alternatives below specialize in different orchestration styles or vendor stacks. Pick based on your team's language, cloud provider, and how much control you need over agent state — not just prototype speed.

| Framework | How it differs from LangChain | Consider when… |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)** | Models agents as a **role-based team** (researcher, analyst, writer) with goals and backstories. You declare who does what; the framework handles delegation and task flow. Less explicit about shared graph state than LangGraph, faster to stand up a multi-agent demo. | You want a working multi-agent prototype quickly, the workflow maps to human roles, and your team is new to agent orchestration. Many teams prototype in CrewAI and move to LangGraph when they need checkpointing or audit-grade control. |
| **[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/)** | Microsoft's unified successor to **AutoGen** and **Semantic Kernel**. Combines conversational multi-agent patterns with graph-based workflows, session state, middleware, and first-class **Python + .NET** runtimes. Tighter Azure / Entra integration than LangChain's provider-agnostic design. | You are on the Microsoft stack (Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, .NET services) and want one supported SDK for enterprise guardrails, telemetry, and long-term maintenance — especially if you already have AutoGen or Semantic Kernel code to migrate. |
| **[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)** | A **minimal, OpenAI-native** layer focused on tool calling, **handoffs** between agents, and built-in tracing/guardrails. Fewer abstractions and integrations than LangChain — you wire more yourself, but the mental model stays small. | You build primarily on OpenAI models, need clean multi-agent delegation with handoffs, and prefer a lightweight SDK over LangChain's broader (and sometimes heavier) composition stack. |
| **[Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)** (Agent Development Kit) | An **opinionated, GCP-native** runtime with hierarchical agent trees, built-in debugging UIs, and integration with Vertex AI. Stronger batteries-included deployment story on Google Cloud; less model-provider flexibility out of the box than LangChain. | Your team is GCP-native, you want an integrated agent runtime on Vertex AI, or you need multimodal / cross-service agents with Google's tooling and A2A (agent-to-agent) protocol support. |
| **[LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/)** | Centers on **data and documents** — event-driven workflows for retrieval, indexing, and query pipelines. LangChain covers RAG too, but LlamaIndex goes deeper on ingestion, chunking, and structured data agents with less emphasis on general tool-calling agents. | Your agent's job is mostly **document-centric** (knowledge bases, log corpora, ticket archives) and you want event-driven orchestration tuned for retrieval and structured data — not a general-purpose ops troubleshooting graph like Part 3. |

Whichever framework you choose, the workshop ideas still apply: define tools with clear schemas, inject playbooks where the model needs guidance, and trace every LLM and tool step so you can evaluate quality in production.
{{< /notice >}}

In this workshop the agent code lives in `part1_agent/`, `part2_agent/`, and `part3_agent/` — each directory is a different orchestration design built on the same shared integrations.

## Review the AI Model as the Reasoning Engine

The **model** (LLM) is the reasoning engine. It interprets alerts and user messages, chooses which tool to call (when the framework allows it), and synthesizes natural-language conclusions from tool output. It does **not** directly query Splunk or Observability unless you give it tools to do so — the model proposes actions; the agent runtime executes them.

Models differ in capability, cost, latency, and context window size. In production you often:

- Use a **stronger model** for complex reasoning or final reports
- Use a **faster or local model** (e.g. Ollama) for iterative development
- Swap providers via configuration without rewriting agent logic — this workshop supports Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and Azure OpenAI through `shared/workshop_shared/llm/`

{{< notice title="Important" style="primary" >}}
Models can **hallucinate** — state plausible but incorrect facts. That is why tool grounding (real metrics, logs, alert JSON) and observability (below) are essential for agent systems you trust in operations.

## Explore MCP Tools Available to the Agent

**Tools** extend the agent beyond text generation. Each tool is a callable function with a name, description, and input schema. The model reads those descriptions and the runtime invokes the tool when the agent decides it needs external data or action.

Common categories:

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Data retrieval** | Fetch live state from systems | APM latency, error rates, Splunk search results |
| **Search & discovery** | Find relevant entities | List services, search alerts/incidents, look up indexes |
| **Action** | Change state (use carefully) | Acknowledge incident, post message, run remediation |
| **Utility** | Support reasoning | Load a skill playbook, format a report, parse JSON |

Tools can be implemented as native Python functions or exposed through **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — a standard way for agents to discover and call capabilities hosted by external servers. In this workshop, Splunk Observability and Splunk Cloud capabilities arrive as MCP tools (prefixed `o11y_`, `splunk_`, etc.) so the agent sees a unified tool list at runtime.

Good tool design drives good agent behavior:

- **Clear names and descriptions** — the model chooses tools based on what it reads
- **Structured inputs/outputs** — JSON beats free-form text for reliability
- **Least privilege** — expose only what the agent needs for the task

**Skills (playbooks)** in Parts 2 and 3 are not tools themselves — they are guidance injected into the agent’s context so it follows a consistent investigation sequence when using tools.

## Monitor Agent Runs with Splunk Agent Observability

Running an agent without observability is like running a microservice with no traces: you see the final response but not **how** the system got there. **Splunk Agent Observability** (and complementary signals such as structured terminal traces and OpenTelemetry) let you monitor agent runs in production and during development.

What to monitor:

| Signal | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Traces / spans** | See each step: LLM calls, tool invocations, graph node transitions |
| **Tool calls** | Which APIs ran, with what inputs, and what came back |
| **Decisions** | Route taken (e.g. APM vs logs), skills loaded, retries |
| **Quality** | Hallucinations, accuracy vs ground truth, completeness of investigation |
| **Latency & cost** | Time per step, tokens used, tool round-trips |

This workshop emphasizes evaluating agents along those dimensions: you will compare Part 1 and Part 3 on the same alert, inspect tool selection, and verify conclusions against real observability data rather than trusting the model’s prose alone.

Structured traces (`AGENT_LOG_TRACE=true`) give immediate feedback in the terminal; Splunk Agent Observability provides session-level views for deeper analysis across many runs — essential when agents move from demo to something operators rely on.
